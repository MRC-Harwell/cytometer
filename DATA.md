## `deepcytometer_pipeline_v8.zip`:  

Weights, colourmaps, etc. necessary to run the pipeline (v8, with mode colour correction). This is currently the latest version 
There are 10 weights files per convolutional neural network (CNN), corresponding to 10-fold cross-validation

quantile colour maps calculated in `klf14_b6ntac_exp_0098_full_slide_size_analysis_v7.py` using the whole Klf14 data set with v7 of the pipeline, and used in earlier experiments, including some where v8 of the pipeline was used for segmentation.  
* `klf14_b6ntac_exp_0106_filename_area2quantile_v8.npz`:  
quantile colour maps calculated in `klf14_b6ntac_exp_0106_full_slide_pipeline_v8.py` using the whole Klf14 data set with v8 of the pipeline, and used in later experiments.
* `klf14_training_colour_histogram.npz`:  
statistics from Klf14 histology images to be used in colour correction
  * `'xbins_edge'`, `'xbins'`:  
  edges and centres of the bins used for histogram calculations
  * `'hist_r_q1'`, `'hist_r_q2'`, `'hist_r_q3'`

  density quartiles (Q1, Q2, Q3) for RGB channels for each bin the histogram
  * `'mode_r'`, `'mode_g'`, `'mode_b'`:  
  modes for RGB channels (this corresponds to the most typical background colour in the histology images)
  * `'mean_l'`, `'mean_a'`, `'mean_b'`:  
  mean intensity for L*a*b channels of the image
  * `'std_l'`, `'std_a'`, `'std_b'`:

  linear interpolation function that maps ECDF quantiles to intensity values in the Klf14 training data set. These functions can be used together with intensity->quantile interpolation functions calculated for a new histology image to perform histogram matching colour correction
  * `'mean_klf14'`, `'std_klf14'`:
