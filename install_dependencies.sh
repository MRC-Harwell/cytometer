#    Script to install the dependencies to run cytometer scripts.
#
#    This script installs several Ubuntu packages, and creates two local conda environments:
#      * cytometer: With the latest versions of Keras/Theano/Tensorflow to run cytometer scripts.
#      * DeepCell: Based on Keras 1.1.1 and Theano 0.9.0 to run DeepCell legacy code.
