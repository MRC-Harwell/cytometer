# Compute confidence interval for a quantile.
#
# Suppose I'm interested in estimating the 37th percentile.  The
# empirical CDF gives me one estimate for that.  I'd like
# to get a confidence interval: I'm 90% confident that the 37th percentile
# lies between X and Y.
#
# You can compute that with two calls to the following function
# (supposing you're interested in [5%-95%] range) by something like the
# following:
# n = len(sorted_data)
# X_index = CDF_error(n,0.37,0.05)
# Y_index = CDF_error(n,0.37,0.95)
# X=sorted_data[X_index]
# Y=sorted_data[Y_index]
# 90% confidence interval is [X,Y]
