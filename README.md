# Summary

This is project "cytometer" by Ramón Casero, Mammalian Genetics 
Unit (MGU), Medical Research Council (MRC) Harwell, UK.

This project contains source code for tha paper by Casero et al., ["Phenotyping of Klf14 mouse white adipose tissue enabled by whole slide segmentation with deep neural networks"](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.03.444997v2), bioRxiv, 2021:

* to segment white adipocytes from whole slides of H&E white adipose tissue histology 
(usually in NDPI files from the microscope, although any other format that can 
be read by `openslide` should work too)
* to phenotype white adipose tissue in Klf14 mice
